## Level 0 - Get on Rails!

**Rails** or [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) is a framework built in [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and designed to create web apps.

In Ruby world, the libraries or the dependencies that we can included in our are called **gems** and they used to be listed on our project **Gemfile**. 

We use [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage our applications' gems.

```bash
bundle install
```

_At this point, we are able to distinguish Rails and Ruby and to understand what are gems, the Gemfile and Bundler._
