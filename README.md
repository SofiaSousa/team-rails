# Welcome to Team-Rails 

Please, be welcomed to the Team-Rails! 

This is a comfy place where we can learn a little more about **Ruby**, **Rails** and web development in general.

The following documentation is organized by levels. Each level represents a new skill that you are invited to learn. 

The goal is not to provide a Holy Bible or Rails (we already have [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and the rest of the Internet for that), but give you the enough basics to keep you interested and of course to make you a team member capable to taking care of our Rails apps.

Throughout this guide, you will find lots of links that may help you to know more about the topics that will be covered here.
